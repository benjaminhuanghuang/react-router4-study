## Install
React Router has been broken into three packages: 
- react-router
- react-router-dom
- react-router-native

You should almost never have to install react-router directly. That package provides the core routing components and functions for React Router applications. The other two provide environment specific (browser and react-native) components, but they both also re-export all of react-router's exports.

For building a website we will install react-router-dom.
```
    npm install --save react-router-dom
```
