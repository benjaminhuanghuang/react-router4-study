## Migrating from v2/v3 to v4
https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/25776d4dc89b8fb2f575884749766355992116b5/packages/react-router/docs/guides/migrating.md#the-router

## V3
```
import { Router, Route, IndexRoute, browserHistory } from 'react-router';

<Router history={browserHistory}>
  <Route path="/" component={App}>
    <IndexRoute component={Welcome} />
    <Route path="signin" component={Signin} />
    <Route path="signout" component={Signout} />
    <Route path="signup" component={Signup} />
    <Route path="feature" component={RequireAuth(Feature)} />
  </Route>
</Router>

```

## V4
react-router-4 has changed in that it no longer has children. However, with the Route component you can render anything that matches the path.

no IndexRoute any more


```
import { BrowserRouter, Route } from 'react-router-dom';


<BrowserRouter>
  <div className="container">
    <Header/>
    <Route exact path="/" component={Landing}/>
    <Route exact path="/surveys" component={Dashboard}/>
    <Route exact path="/surveys/new" component={SurveyNew}/>
  </div>
</BrowserRouter>
```
